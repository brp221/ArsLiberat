Ars Liberat is a project which aids NFT enthusiasts in exploring and buying art. It provides guidance and automation for art collectors 
so that they can shift their focus form the boring stuff such as staring at their screen until their new favorite NFT gets listed to enjoying art and 
learning more about the blockchain. 

As Web3 prevails and the Metaverse marches on, blockchain products will continue to flood the internet. It is our goal for Ars Liberat to be among these
products. We strive to deliver mechanisms by which user participation in the NFT space is made easier thus encouraging more people to learn and join this 
crazy world of digital art.
